kibana-proxy
============

Hosts [Kibana 3](http://three.kibana.org) as a nodejs express application.

Features:
- Proxy access to Elasticsearch: all elasticsearch queries are sent through the express application.
- Optional Google OAuth2 login with (passport)[http://passport.org].
- Support for Elasticsearch protected by basic-authentication: only the express app will know about the username and password.

Usage
=====

```
git clone git@github.com:hmalphettes/kibana-proxy.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
npm install
node app.js &
open http://localhost:3003
```

Configuration
=============
Configuration is done via environment variables:
- `ES_URL`: example: `http://user:password@your-elasticsearch.local`; default: `http://localhost:9200`
- `PORT`: the port where the app is run, default to `VCAP_PORT` and then to `3003`.
- `APP_ID`, `APP_SECRET`: Google OAuth2 config. Optional.
- `AUTHORIZED_EMAILS`: define what authenticated email is granted access; a comma separated listed of patterns; defaults to `*`. example: `*@stoic.com,justme@gmail.com` each pattern must be one-of:
    - `*`: anything,
    - `*@domain`: any email in the domain
    - `an@email`: a specific email.

Push to cloudfoundry.com
========================
- Copy the `manifest-example.yml` file as `manifest-real.yml` provided as an example.
- Must: change the name of the app and elasticsearch URL.
- Could: add `APP_ID`, `APP_SECRET` and `AUTHORIZED_EMAILS` to protect access.
