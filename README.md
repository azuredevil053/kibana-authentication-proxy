kibana Authentication Proxy
============

Hosts the latest [kibana3](www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/) and elasticsearch behind Google OAuth2 or Basic Authentication with NodeJS and Express.

- A proxy between Elasticsearch, kibana3 and user client
- Support Elasticsearch which protected by basic authentication, only kibana-authentication-proxy knows the user/passwd
- Compatible with the latest kibana3
- Support Google OAuth2 and Basic Authentication(multiple users supported) to authorize users
- Inspired by and based on [kibana-proxy](https://github.com/hmalphettes/kibana-proxy), most of the proxy libraries were written by them

*We NO LONGER support third-party plugins such as `Bigdesk` or `Head` since it's hard to test and maintain the dependency*
